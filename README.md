The main goal of this project is to replicate as many functions as possible that are found on a standard graphing/scientific calculator. The majority of it will be utilizing the terminal and be written in plain java, using processing to graph the equations. It will have the ability to store and manipulate variables, including standard number formats, int, float, fraction, and simple data structures such as matrices, equations, lists, and points. The tentative plan for graphing is for the equations to be declared in the command line, and then call a processing executable to graph them, with manipulation available. The rest of the functions will all be available through parsing of the terminal inputs.
